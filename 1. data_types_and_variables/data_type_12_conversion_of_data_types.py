Conversion of Data Types in Python:
Based on requirements, developers can convert from one data type into another data type explicitly, 
this is called type conversion. Python provides inbuilt functions to convert from one type to another type.

1. int() : convert from other type into int type
2. float() : convert from other type into float type
3. complex() : convert from other type into complex type
4. bool() : convert from other type into bool type
5. str() : convert from other type into str type
