'''
Complex Data Type in python:
The complex data type represents the numbers that are written in the form of a+bj or a-bj, 
here a is representing a real part of the number and b is representing an imaginary part of the number. 
The suffix small j or upper J after b indicates the square root of -1. 
The part “a” and “b” may contain integers or floats.
'''

a = 3+5j
b = 2-5.5j
c = 3+10.5j
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print()
print(a+b)
print(b+c)
print(c+a)


'''
OUTPUT:
(3+5j)
(2-5.5j)
(3+10.5j)

(5-0.5j)
(5+5j)
(6+15.5j)
